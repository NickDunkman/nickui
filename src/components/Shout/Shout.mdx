## Accessibility considerations

Since Shouts are intended to be prominent messages & are often added to the page
after the user takes some kind of action, such as a success or error message
after a form submission, you should take care to use the `role` and `aria-live`
props appropriately, so that your message is announced to the user in the right
way.

When adding success message, you probably want it to be announced to the user,
but without yanking their attention if they‚Äôre busy with something else:

<Source
  dark
  language="tsx"
  code={`
    <Shout
      role="status"
      aria-live="polite"
      flavor="positive"
    >
      Hey that was a good form submission üëç
    </Shout>
  `}
/>

When adding an error message, you probably want it to be announced in an urgent
way:

<Source
  dark
  language="tsx"
  code={`
    <Shout
      role="alert"
      aria-live="assertive"
      flavor="negative"
    >
      There was a problem with your visa application submission. If you don‚Äôt
      fix and resubmit, you will be apprehended at the border.
    </Shout>
  `}
/>
