# `<CheckedField>`

Wraps a single checkable form control with a standard layout (label & explainer,
to the right of the control).

This is simpler than the [Field](/docs/field-layouts-field--docs/) component.
There’s no hint, since a field with only 2 possible values is too simple for it.
And there’s no error message, since if one or both possible values is invalid,
the field has no purpose.

Note: this layout is already built-into
[Checkbox](/docs/form-controls-checkbox--docs/),
[Radio](/docs/form-controls-radio--docs/), and
[Switch](/docs/form-controls-switch--docs/)—you can use this component to create
a custom form control that behaves the same way.

<FakeCanvas>
  <CheckedField
    label="A label"
    explainer="An explainer"
    sizer={CheckedField.sizer.medium}
  >
    <FormControlPlaceholder tiny />
  </CheckedField>
</FakeCanvas>

<TableOfContents />

## Props

In addition to the commonly used props below, you can pass any prop accepted by
the [&lt;div&gt;](htps://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common)
element, which will be applied to the CheckedField's root div.

<ArgTypes of={CheckedField} sort="requiredFirst" />

## Basic elements

These elements are controlled using the `label`, `explainer`, and `hint` props.

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} sourceState="shown" />

## Sizing

Sizing is done via the `sizer` prop. You can pass "small", "medium", or "large".
In keeping with the mobile-first philosophy of Tailwind, the default size is
"small".

<Canvas of={Stories.AllSizes} />
