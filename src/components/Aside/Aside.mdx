      The Presidio of San Francisco (originally, El Presidio Real de San
      Francisco or The Royal Fortress of Saint Francis) is a park and former
      U.S. Army post on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula in San
      Francisco, California, and is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation
      Area.

      It had been a fortified location since September 17, 1776, when New Spain
      established the presidio to gain a foothold in Alta California and the San
      Francisco Bay. It passed to Mexico in 1820, which in turn passed it to the
      United States in 1848. As part of a military reduction program under the
      Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process from 1988, Congress voted to
      end the Presidio's status as an active military installation of the U.S.
      Army. On October 1, 1994, it was transferred to the National Park Service,
      ending 219 years of military use and beginning its next phase of mixed
      commercial and public use.

## Adding content

You can pass arbitrary content via the `children` prop, but typically youâ€™ll use
`Aside.Heading` and `Aside.Paragraph`, which ensure accessibilty and a
consistent look and feel. Both accept `className` overrides, and the
`Aside.Heading` allows you to override which heading tag is used (such as `<h1>`
or `<h5>`).
