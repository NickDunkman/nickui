# `<Field>`

Field wraps a form control in a standard form field layout (label, hint, error
message, etc).

## Props

In addition to the commonly used props below, you can pass any prop accepted by
the [&lt;div&gt;](htps://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common)
element, which will be applied to the Field's root div.

<ArgTypes of={Field} sort="requiredFirst" />

## Basic elements

These elements are controlled using the `label`, `explainer`, and `hint` props.

<Canvas of={Stories.Basic} sourceState="shown" />

## Sizing

Sizing is done via the `sizer` prop. You can pass "small", "medium", or "large".
In keeping with the mobile-first philosophy of Tailwind, the default size is
"small".

<Canvas of={Stories.AllSizes} sourceState="shown" />

## Errors

To add an error message, use the `error` prop. If you want to show the error
style without adding a message, you can set the error prop to `true`.

<Canvas of={Stories.Error} sourceState="shown" />

## Required fields

The standard way to designate that a required field is to use the `required`
prop to add an asterisk to the end of the label.

<Canvas of={Stories.Required} sourceState="shown" />
