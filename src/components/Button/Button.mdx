# `<Button>`

Buttons allow the user to trigger an action, such as submitting a form.

## Props

Button takes some custom props, plus all the props that can be used with
[&lt;button&gt;](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common). Here
are some of the most commonly used:

<ArgTypes of={Button} sort="requiredFirst" />

## Control states

These are handled via the `disabled` prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.AllControlStates} sourceState="shown" />

## Sizing

Sizing is done via the `sizer` prop. You can pass "small", "medium", or "large".
In keeping with the mobile-first philosophy of Tailwind, the default size is
"small".

<Canvas of={Stories.AllSizes} sourceState="shown" />

## Flavors

Coloring is done via the `flavor` prop. You can pass "primary", "secondary", or
"danger". The default flavor is "primary".

<Canvas of={Stories.AllFlavors} sourceState="shown" />
