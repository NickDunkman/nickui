    NickUI is a little component library I worked on after taking a gap year to
    start coding again and rebuild some confidence. Along the way, I explored
    some new technologies (like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/),
    [Vite](https://vite.dev/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), [React Hook
    Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/), and [Nx](https://nx.dev/)) and went
    a little deeper into frontend devops and
    [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) customization.

    The components here are an evolution of some of the work I did for my [last
    startup‚Äôs design system](https://phenotypes.amino.com). They‚Äôve been rebuilt
    from the ground up with these goals in mind:
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      **Integration with Tailwind.** 100% of the styling is done with Tailwind,
      and the component APIs aim to be Tailwind-esque where applicable, to make
      them intuitive in an app that is using Tailwind. For example, the
      component sizers use Tailwind sizing terms (`"base"` is the default size),
      and they can be prefixed with Tailwind breakpoint prefixes (like
      `"xl:large"`). With a little more work, this repo could publish a package
      that is fully compatible with the consuming app's Tailwind overrides.
    </li>
    <li>
      **Full accessibility.** All components are essentially extensions of the
      appropriate native HTML elements. These elements are out-of-the-box
      accessible with assistive devices when chosen correctly, and they come
      with all kinds of neat props. Where visual, behavioral, or usability
      flourishes have been added, care has been taken to ensure they don‚Äôt
      inhibit users relying on assistive devices. Colors and contrast ratios
      have been selected carefully for visual users. Keyboard interactivity is
      intuitive and on-par with the corresponding native elements. All tests are
      written using the accessibilty DOM. Check out the "accessibility" tab on
      any story to see compliance!
    </li>
    <li>
      **Developer ergonomics.** One of the joyful things about building
      components is considering the tradeoffs between flexibility vs ensured
      consistency, and where different concerns should lie. These components
      have been designed to take the work of accessibility and look+feel out of
      your hands by default. In general, you‚Äôre able to override any of these
      aspects if you have a customization need, but then you‚Äôre responsible for
      them. By removing these concerns from your application, you can write less
      code (accessibility in particular often requires a ton of boilerplate
      pipe-ery), and your application code can read more purely as business
      logic (‚Äúthis is the business-relevant language that should be used to
      label this field‚Äù, ‚Äúthese are the options‚Äù, ‚Äúthis is what should happen
      when the user makes a selection‚Äù ...).
    </li>
  </ul>

    One thing I really enjoyed during this project was thinking of ways to make
    my storybook docs more powerful, and cut down on the amount of boilerplate I
    had to add to each component‚Äôs docs. If you‚Äôre inspired by anything you see,
    feel free to peep the [custom "doc blocks" I
    created](https://github.com/NickDunkman/nickui/tree/main/src/docs)!
